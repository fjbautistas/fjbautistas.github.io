  I'm a physicist and candidate of Master of Sciences in physics from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, currently living in Bogotá D. C. I have experience in nuclear physics (theoretical and experimental). Also, I have over two years using machine learning methods and Bayesian inference. I want to apply all of this to practical physics projects. 

  My professional interests include nuclear physics, nuclear instrumentation, data analysis, bayesian inferences and, astronomy and software development in general.

          Design of new analytic methods for $\gamma$ spectroscopy applied to basic research focused on:

          - Software development for gamma spectroscopy analyses employing C++ and Python.
          - Characterization of efficiency and resoluction for HPGe detectors, scintillator detectors such as NaI(2x2), NaI(3x3), CsI(2x2), BGO(2x2) detectors, among others.
          - Modeling of extended source and position optimization for HPGe detector.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
